# VeriPress Theme "r"

In fact, this is just a copy of the theme of this blog [https://ramon.codes](https://ramon.codes), hope there won't be any copyright issue.

# Installation

```sh
veripress theme install richardchien/veripress-theme-r --name r
```

This command will install the theme to `themes/r`. After this, change `THEME` in `config.py` to `'r'` to use it.

Enjoy!
